# Route-Mobile-Travel-Guide-
Prototype of travel guide idea for Route Mobile Hackathon.

#Contents-

Travel guide front end and back end code.
Designs and documentation of our idea.

Basic design illustrations are in ../static/assets
Documentation will be made soon...

#Instructions-

Download the entire main branch to a folder.
Run "run.py" in the main branch in command prompt or terminal with Python3.
If it isn't possible, manually go to ../app/templates and run "newhome.html" This is not recommended, as it disables a few features, such as the account authentication system.

#User Interface-

Running "run.py" with open "newhome.html" on your browser. On this site, the user will have to either create an account or log in. Once logged in, the user will have access to multiple pages. The user will be able to plan a trip to get recommendations in that area. The user will be able to see your past trips, nearby activities, global rankings of places, and be able to manage their data, and what can be used to give travel recommendations.


#WhatsApp/SMS Integration-

When creating an account, the sign up page will require you to input your phone number. Once an account is created, a message from the TGuide client will be sent out to the user to confirm the account and to configure the WhatsApp/SMS client. (eg. When to contact the user, and how often) Once the user has planned their trip, the user will be able to use WhatsApp/SMS to contact the TGuide client. Asking the TGuide client on WhatsApp/SMS for recommendations will let the TGuide client make a persolized recommendation for the user, and send a message to the user. After a while, the TGuide client will ask for a rating of the place, which is an optional thing to reply to. Although if the user replies, the next recommendations will be more accurate. and more customized, so it is recommended to.
